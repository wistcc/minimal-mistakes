Letâ€™s be honest, I haven't been a reader person my entire life. Sure, I've read tons of blog post, short stories, and a lot of tweets, but just the idea of start reading a book scared me. For some reason, I always found it a very boring activity.

However, I know the great benefits this could bring to me. This year I decided to make this a habit in my life. Today I want to share with you the books I read this first semester of the year.

## [Ready Player One by Ernest Cline](https://amzn.to/2NKIRrB){:target="_blank"}
I love this book. Once I started reading it, I wasn't able to stop until the end.

The world is a chaotic place in the year 2045 and people get to escape this reality using the OASIS, a virtual reality game. Some hidden puzzles can give someone massive power and fortune. This cannot end into the wrong hands or everyone could lose the freedom this new world provides.

## [Armada by Ernest Cline](https://amzn.to/2JSyVK2){:target="_blank"}
After loving Ready Player One, I decided to read another book by the same author. Armada is a very engaging story where the Zack Lightman gets to use his knowledge in science fiction books, movies, and video games to try to save the world.

## [The Power Of Less: The Fine Art of Limiting Yourself to the Essential by Leo Babauta](https://amzn.to/2uNjCxp){:target="_blank"}
Thanks to this book I was able to create the habit of doing a to-do list starting the day, giving priority to the most important things and also to not forget others through the day. This helps me get more things done every day.

## [The 10X Rule: The Only Difference Between Success and Failure by Grant Cardone](https://amzn.to/2A4i2MO){:target="_blank"}
In order to achieve big goals, you need to start taking massive actions since operating in normal action won't get you there. Discover the reasons why people fail and others succeed, among other things.

## [Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill](https://amzn.to/2A9vzTt){:target="_blank"}
Following the principles explained by the author, you could get richness in any aspect of your life that you want. These principles will help you to  convert your burning desire in its material form.

I would love to get some book recommendations in the comments. Also, if you have already read the books I mentioned, let me know what you think about them.
