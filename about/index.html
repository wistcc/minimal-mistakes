<h3 class="archive__subtitle">About this blog</h3>
<p>
The main goal of this blog is to learn together. I’m not an expert on any subject written here, so, the idea is to be a better software engineer sharing, collaborating and having good conversations about different topics.
</p>
<p>
I would love to have a very respectful space where everybody can share anything without getting criticized in the wrong way. Instead, let’s use this space to learn from others, and also talk about your own experience since this will help you to learn even more.
</p>
<p>
I’ll be writing about things I see while using different programming languages, frameworks, tools and more. Problems I encountered on my daily basis and how I solved them. If you noticed that I wrote about something that is wrong, please correct me and let us all know what do you think is the best way to approach this matter.
</p>
<p>
I hope my notes here can help you solve some problems you encounter yourself in your daily life.
</p>
<p>
Happy coding!
